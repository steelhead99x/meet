# Blur Effect Default & Local Storage Implementation

## Summary
Implemented blur effect as the default background setting for all users, with automatic local storage persistence to remember user preferences across sessions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Default Settings (Already Configured)
- **File**: `lib/userPreferences.ts`
- **Default**: Blur is enabled by default (`backgroundType: 'blur'`, `blurQuality: 'medium'`)
- All first-time users will see blur effect enabled automatically

### 2. PreJoin Screen (CustomPreJoin.tsx)
**Added initialization logic:**
- On first visit, automatically saves all default preferences (including blur) to localStorage
- This happens as soon as the preview screen loads

**Enhanced join submission:**
- When user clicks "Join Room", ALL preferences are now saved
- Previously only saved username, video/audio enabled, and device IDs
- Now also saves: `backgroundType`, `backgroundPath`, `blurQuality`, `useCustomSegmentation`, `customSegmentation`, `noiseFilterEnabled`

### 3. In-Room Camera Settings (CameraSettings.tsx)
**Added initialization logic:**
- On first load, checks if user has any saved preferences
- If not (first-time user), automatically saves all default settings including blur
- Ensures users who bypass prejoin screen also get their settings saved

### 4. Settings Persistence
All user preference changes are automatically saved to localStorage:
- Background type changes (none, blur, image, gradient, custom)
- Blur quality changes (low, medium, high, ultra)
- Custom segmentation settings
- Device selections (camera, microphone)
- Video/audio enabled states

## User Experience

### First-Time User Journey
1. **User opens prejoin screen**: 
   - Blur is automatically enabled on video preview
   - Settings are saved to localStorage immediately
   
2. **User joins room**:
   - All current settings are saved (including blur defaults)
   - No action required from user

3. **User returns later**:
   - Their previous settings (blur enabled) are loaded from localStorage
   - Consistent experience across sessions

### Changing Settings
1. **User changes background to "none"**:
   - Setting is immediately saved to localStorage
   
2. **User returns later**:
   - "None" setting is loaded from localStorage
   - User's preference is respected

3. **User changes blur quality or any other setting**:
   - All changes are persisted automatically
   - Settings are remembered on next visit

## Technical Implementation

### Local Storage Key
- Storage key: `'livekit-user-preferences'`
- Stores complete `UserPreferences` object as JSON

### Saved Preferences Include:
```typescript
{
  videoEnabled: boolean;
  videoDeviceId?: string;
  backgroundType: 'none' | 'blur' | 'image' | 'gradient' | 'custom-video' | 'custom-image';
  backgroundPath?: string;
  blurQuality: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'ultra';
  useCustomSegmentation?: boolean;
  customSegmentation?: CustomSegmentationSettings;
  audioEnabled: boolean;
  audioDeviceId?: string;
  noiseFilterEnabled: boolean;
  username?: string;
}
```

### Default Values (First Visit):
```typescript
{
  videoEnabled: true,
  backgroundType: 'blur',    // BLUR ENABLED BY DEFAULT
  blurQuality: 'medium',     // Auto-adjusted based on device capabilities
  audioEnabled: true,
  noiseFilterEnabled: true,
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: First-Time User
1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Open prejoin screen
3. Verify blur is applied to video preview
4. Open DevTools Console
5. Check for log: `[CustomPreJoin] First visit - saved default preferences including blur`
6. Check localStorage: `localStorage.getItem('livekit-user-preferences')`
7. Verify `backgroundType: 'blur'` is saved

### Test Case 2: Returning User with Saved Settings
1. Join room with blur enabled
2. Change background to "none"
3. Close browser/tab
4. Reopen prejoin screen
5. Verify "none" is loaded (no blur)

### Test Case 3: Settings Persistence
1. Clear localStorage
2. Open prejoin with blur enabled (default)
3. Join room
4. Change blur quality to "high" in settings menu
5. Refresh page
6. Verify "high" quality blur is applied

### Test Case 4: Custom Background Persistence
1. Upload custom background
2. Select it
3. Join room
4. Return to room
5. Verify custom background is still selected

## Console Logs for Debugging

The implementation includes comprehensive logging:

```
[CustomPreJoin] First visit - saved default preferences including blur
[CameraSettings] First visit - saved default preferences including blur
[CameraSettings] Loaded preferences: { backgroundType: 'blur', ... }
[UserPreferences] Saved preferences: { ... }
[BlurConfig] Blur quality changed to: high
[CameraSettings] Background changed to: blur
```

## Benefits

1. **Privacy by Default**: Users get blur protection from first moment
2. **Consistent Experience**: Settings persist across sessions
3. **User Control**: Any setting change is remembered
4. **Automatic**: No manual "save" button needed
5. **Flexible**: Works with prejoin or direct room entry
6. **Comprehensive**: All preferences are saved together

## Files Modified

1. `lib/CustomPreJoin.tsx`
   - Added initialization effect to save defaults on first visit
   - Enhanced `handleSubmit` to save all preferences

2. `lib/CameraSettings.tsx`
   - Added initialization effect to save defaults on first visit

3. `lib/userPreferences.ts`
   - Already had blur as default (no changes needed)

## Migration for Existing Users

Users who already have saved preferences will not be affected:
- Their existing settings are preserved
- Defaults only apply to new users or users without saved preferences
- No data loss or reset of existing preferences
