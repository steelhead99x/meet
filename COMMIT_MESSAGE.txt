feat: Add default blur and user preferences persistence

Implemented two major features to improve user experience:

1. Background Blur Enabled by Default
   - All users now have background blur automatically enabled on first use
   - Blur quality auto-detects based on device capabilities (low/medium/high/ultra)
   - Provides privacy protection out of the box

2. User Preferences Local Storage
   - All settings now persist across browser sessions
   - Saved preferences include:
     * Video/audio enabled state
     * Selected camera/microphone devices
     * Background effect type and selection
     * Blur quality level
     * Noise cancellation state
     * Username
   - Seamless rejoin experience with no reconfiguration needed

Technical Changes:
- Created lib/userPreferences.ts for centralized preferences management
- Updated CameraSettings.tsx to default to blur and save background prefs
- Updated MicrophoneSettings.tsx to save noise filter preferences
- Updated CustomPreJoin.tsx to load/save all prejoin preferences
- Added comprehensive documentation and testing guides

Build Status: âœ… All tests pass, no errors
