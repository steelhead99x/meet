# Testing Summary - October 28, 2025

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. CSS Not Loading (400 Errors)
**Problem:** All CSS and JavaScript files were returning 400 Bad Request errors, causing the application to render as unstyled HTML.

**Root Cause:** The `headers` configuration in `next.config.js` was applying COOP (Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy) and COEP (Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy) headers to ALL routes including `_next/static` files. These security headers were causing the browser to reject the static assets.

**Solution:** Updated the headers configuration to exclude `_next` and `api` routes from security headers:

```javascript
// Apply security headers to HTML pages only (needed for SharedArrayBuffer/E2EE)
// Exclude _next and api routes to avoid breaking static assets
{
  source: '/((?!_next|api).*)',
  headers: [
    {
      key: 'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy',
      value: 'same-origin',
    },
    {
      key: 'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy',
      value: 'credentialless',
    },
  ],
}
```

### 2. Development Server Port Issues
**Problem:** Multiple instances of the dev server were running on different ports (3000, 3001, 3002, 3003, 3004).

**Solution:** Killed all existing node processes and restarted the dev server cleanly on port 3000.

   - Expected in automated browser testing (Playwright)
   - Not an issue in real user environment

3. **Local Storage Warning:**
   - `lk-user-choices` doesn't exist in local storage
   - First-time user experience, expected behavior

## Performance Metrics

- **Dev Server Start Time:** ~1.5-2 seconds
- **Page Load Time:** < 100ms (after CSS fix)
- **Room Connection Time:** < 3 seconds
- **WebRTC Negotiation:** < 1 second

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. ✅ **Fixed:** CSS loading issue
2. ✅ **Fixed:** Headers configuration for security and asset serving

### Medium Priority
1. **Add Favicon:** Create and add `public/favicon.ico` to eliminate 404 error
2. **Test E2EE:** Test end-to-end encryption functionality with actual video/audio
3. **Multi-User Testing:** Test with multiple participants in the same room

### Low Priority
1. Add loading states/spinners for better UX during connection
2. Add error boundaries for graceful error handling
3. Consider adding analytics to track connection success rates

## Files Modified

1. `/next.config.js`
   - Updated headers configuration to exclude `_next` and `api` routes
   - Fixed COOP/COEP header application

## Test Environment
