### How It Works

#### Chat Permissions
- Chat permissions are controlled by the LiveKit access token
- The token grants `canPublishData: true` which enables chat functionality
- The `useLocalParticipantPermissions` hook retrieves these permissions
- Original issue: Chat button was hidden if permissions weren't loaded yet
- **Fix**: Added CSS rules to force visibility regardless of permission state

#### Chat Toggle State
- Chat visibility is managed by LiveKit's `LayoutContext`
- The `widgetState.showChat` boolean controls panel visibility
- Keyboard shortcuts dispatch `show_chat` actions to the layout context
- Button has `aria-pressed` attribute for accessibility

#### Message Encoding
- Chat messages are currently unencrypted (fallback mode)
- Encoder/decoder functions are provided but use simple text encoding
- E2EE for chat messages is planned for future implementation
- Worker is passed but not currently used for chat encryption

### Dependencies
- **@livekit/components-react**: 2.9.15
- **livekit-client**: 2.15.14
- Uses LiveKit's built-in Chat component
- Leverages LiveKit's LayoutContext for state management

### Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Keyboard shortcuts work on both Mac (Cmd) and Windows/Linux (Ctrl)
- Mobile browsers support touch interactions
- Responsive design adapts to screen size
