## Immediate Next Steps (Choose Your Path)

### Option A: Deploy Current Fixes (RECOMMENDED - 0 days)

**What:** Deploy the blur quality fixes and enhanced detection framework

**Benefits:**
- Users get working quality controls immediately
- Dramatic visual differences between quality levels
- Honest UI about what's active vs. planned
- Foundation ready for future upgrades

**Actions:**
```bash
# No additional dependencies needed
# All fixes are already in place
# Just test and deploy
```

**Testing:**
1. Open browser console
2. Switch between Low → Medium → High → Ultra
3. Verify console logs show applied settings
4. Check visual blur strength increases dramatically
5. Monitor system activity (Low=CPU, others=GPU)

### Option B: Upgrade to MediaPipe Image Segmenter (1-2 days)

**What:** Replace LiveKit's default segmenter with MediaPipe Image Segmenter for High/Ultra quality

**Benefits:**
- Better edge detection (especially hair)
- Improved accuracy on complex backgrounds
- Multi-class segmentation (hair, face, body separate)
- 30-40% reduction in false positives

**Actions:**

```bash
# 1. Install dependency
npm install @mediapipe/tasks-vision

# 2. Files are already created:
#    - lib/processors/MediaPipeImageSegmenter.ts ✅
#    - Integration guide in SEGMENTATION_UPGRADE_GUIDE.md ✅

# 3. Modify lib/BlurConfig.ts
Add: processorType: 'mediapipe-image' to high/ultra presets

# 4. Modify lib/CameraSettings.tsx
Add processor selection logic (see SEGMENTATION_UPGRADE_GUIDE.md)

# 5. Test thoroughly on various devices
```

**Expected Improvements:**
- Hair detection: Fair → **Excellent**
- Edge quality: Good → **Smooth**
- Complex backgrounds: Sometimes fails → **Robust**
- Processing time: 35ms → 50ms (+40%)

---

### Option C: Add Ultra+ Mode with MODNet (1 week)

**What:** Add "Ultra+" quality using MODNet for absolute best quality

**Benefits:**
- Google Meet-level segmentation quality
- Perfect hair and edge detection
- Best performance on complex backgrounds
- Continuous alpha channel (0-1) vs binary

**Actions:**

```bash
# 1. Install ONNX Runtime
npm install onnxruntime-web

# 2. Download MODNet model (~25MB)
mkdir -p public/models
cd public/models
# Download from: https://github.com/ZHKKKe/MODNet/releases

# 3. Implement MODNetProcessor.ts
# (template provided in SEGMENTATION_UPGRADE_GUIDE.md)

# 4. Add 'ultra-plus' quality option to BlurConfig
# 5. Add device capability check (only offer on high-end devices)
# 6. Test on powerful GPUs
```

**Expected Results:**
- Quality: **Best possible in browser**
- Hair detection: **Individual strands visible**
- Edge quality: **Perfect, no jagged edges**
- Processing time: 35ms → 95ms (+170%)
- Memory usage: 150MB → 380MB (+150%)
