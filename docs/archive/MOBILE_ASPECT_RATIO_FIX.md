# Mobile Video Aspect Ratio Fix

## Problem
On mobile phone layouts, videos with 2 participants were displaying too vertically (tall and narrow), not maintaining proper 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratios. The videos were stretching to fill the available grid space rather than maintaining their intended proportions.

## Root Cause
The CSS grid layout for mobile devices was using `grid-auto-rows: minmax(150px, 1fr)`, which caused rows to expand to fill available vertical space. This overrode the `aspect-ratio: 16/9` constraint on participant tiles, resulting in distorted videos on portrait mobile screens.

## Solution

### 1. Grid Row Sizing (`styles/modern-theme.css`)
Changed the mobile grid layout to use `grid-auto-rows: auto` instead of `minmax(150px, 1fr)`. This allows rows to size based on the content's aspect ratio rather than trying to fill available space.

**Changes applied to:**
- Single participant layout
- 2 participants (side-by-side)
- 3-4 participants (2x2 grid)
- 5-9 participants (3-column grid)
- 10+ participants (auto-fit grid)

### 2. Vertical Centering
Added `align-content: center` to the mobile grid layout to center videos vertically when they don't fill the entire viewport height.

### 3. Fullscreen Portrait Mode Support
Added special handling for fullscreen mode on mobile portrait orientation:
- **Single participant in fullscreen:** Allows video to stretch to fill the full screen (removes aspect-ratio constraint)
- **Multiple participants in fullscreen:** Maintains aspect ratios but aligns content to the top for better space usage

### 4. Aspect Ratio Reinforcement (`styles/globals.css`)
Added `height: auto` to `.lk-participant-tile` to ensure height is determined by the aspect ratio property rather than any grid constraints.

## Behavior Summary

### Normal Mobile View (Portrait)
- ✅ Videos maintain 16:9 aspect ratio
- ✅ Videos scale based on screen width
- ✅ Videos are centered vertically with space above/below if needed
- ✅ No distortion or vertical stretching

### Fullscreen Mode (Portrait)
- ✅ Single participant: Video fills the entire screen (portrait aspect allowed)
- ✅ Multiple participants: Maintain 16:9 aspect ratio, aligned to top

### Landscape Mobile
- ✅ Uses same aspect ratio rules
- ✅ Videos scale to fit available width

## Files Modified
1. `/styles/modern-theme.css` - Updated mobile grid layout rules (lines ~2013-2053, 2086-2102)
2. `/styles/globals.css` - Reinforced participant tile aspect ratio (line 168)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with 2 participants on a portrait mobile device (e.g., iPhone, Android phone)
2. Verify videos maintain proper aspect ratio and don't appear too tall/narrow
3. Test fullscreen behavior - single participant should fill screen in portrait
4. Test with 3, 4, and more participants to ensure grid scaling works correctly
5. Test in both portrait and landscape orientations

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers: Uses `aspect-ratio` CSS property
- Older browsers: Fallback using padding-bottom trick (already implemented in `globals.css`)
- Fullscreen API: Uses standard `:fullscreen` and vendor prefixes (`-webkit-full-screen`, `-moz-full-screen`)
