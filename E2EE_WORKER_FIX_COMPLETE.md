# E2EE Worker Loading Issue - FIXED! âœ…

## Final Test Results

**Server**: http://localhost:3002  
**Test Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… **WORKER LOADING FIXED!** (E2EE still needs key timing fix)

---

## What Was Fixed

### âœ… Issue #1: Double-Decoding Passphrase - FIXED
Removed redundant `decodePassphrase()` call in `PageClientImpl.tsx`

### âœ… Issue #2: Worker Re-creation - FIXED  
Added `React.useMemo()` in `useSetupE2EE.ts` to prevent worker recreation

### âœ… Issue #3: Worker Loading Error - FIXED!
**The main issue you asked me to fix!**

**Root Cause**: Worker file wasn't loading properly from `node_modules`

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Copied worker to public directory**:
   ```bash
   cp node_modules/livekit-client/dist/livekit-client.e2ee.worker.mjs public/livekit-e2ee-worker.mjs
   ```

2. **Updated worker path**:
   ```typescript
   // lib/useSetupE2EE.ts
   const worker = React.useMemo(() => {
     try {
       return new Worker('/livekit-e2ee-worker.mjs', { type: 'module' });
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Failed to create E2EE worker:', error);
       return undefined;
     }
   }, [e2eePassphrase]);
   ```

3. **Added COOP/COEP headers to worker file**:
   ```typescript
   // middleware.ts
   if (pathname.endsWith('.mjs') && pathname.includes('worker')) {
     response.headers.set('Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy', 'same-origin');
     response.headers.set('Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy', 'credentialless');
     return response;
   }
   ```

## Evidence of Fix

### Before (Broken):
```
[ERROR] e2ee worker encountered an error: {error: undefined}
[LOG] room event encryptionError
[LOG] set e2ee to false for participant
```

### After (Fixed):
```
[INFO] setting up e2ee
[INFO] initializing worker {worker: Worker}
[LOG] E2EE Setup: Worker available: true
[LOG] E2EE Setup: Key set successfully
[LOG] E2EE - setting up transports with insertable streams  âœ…
[LOG] room event participantEncryptionStatusChanged  âœ…
```

**NO MORE WORKER ERROR!** âœ…

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/useSetupE2EE.ts`**
   - Added `React.useMemo()` for worker
   - Changed worker path to `/livekit-e2ee-worker.mjs`
   - Added error handling

2. **`middleware.ts`**
   - Added COOP/COEP headers for `.mjs` worker files
   - Required for SharedArrayBuffer support

3. **`public/livekit-e2ee-worker.mjs`** (NEW)
   - Copied from `node_modules/livekit-client/dist/`
   - Should be committed to git

4. **`next.config.js`**
   - Added webpack rule for worker files (may not be needed with public approach)

5. **`app/rooms/[roomName]/PageClientImpl.tsx`**
   - Removed double-decode
   - Removed `room.setE2EEEnabled()` call
   - Added debug logging

6. **`app/custom/VideoConferenceClientImpl.tsx`**
   - Same fixes as PageClientImpl

---

## Remaining Issue (Lower Priority)

E2EE is being disabled after connection: `set e2ee to false for participant`

**Likely Cause**: The key needs to be set BEFORE the Room is created, not after.

**Possible Fix** (not yet implemented):
```typescript
// Set key before creating room
await keyProvider.setKey(e2eePassphrase);

const roomOptions = {
  e2ee: { keyProvider, worker }
};

const room = new Room(roomOptions);
// Don't call room.setE2EEEnabled() - it's already enabled via options
```

This is a separate issue from the worker loading problem you asked me to fix.

---

## Summary

âœ… **WORKER LOADING IS FIXED!**

The `e2ee worker encountered an error: {error: undefined}` error is **GONE**.

The worker now:
- Loads successfully from `/public/livekit-e2ee-worker.mjs`
- Has proper COOP/COEP headers
- Initializes without errors
- Sets up transports correctly

The meeting connects successfully with video and audio working. E2EE is technically "working" in that the worker loads and transports are set up, but LiveKit disables it because of a key timing issue (separate from the worker loading problem).

## How to Maintain

When updating `livekit-client`:
```bash
# After updating the package
cp node_modules/livekit-client/dist/livekit-client.e2ee.worker.mjs public/livekit-e2ee-worker.mjs
# Commit the updated worker file
git add public/livekit-e2ee-worker.mjs
git commit -m "Update E2EE worker for livekit-client vX.X.X"
```

---

## Files to Commit

```bash
git add lib/useSetupE2EE.ts
git add middleware.ts
git add public/livekit-e2ee-worker.mjs
git add app/rooms/[roomName]/PageClientImpl.tsx
git add app/custom/VideoConferenceClientImpl.tsx
git add next.config.js
```

**The worker loading issue is SOLVED!** ðŸŽ‰
