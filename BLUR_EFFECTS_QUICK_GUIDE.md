# Blur Effects Fix - Quick Reference Guide

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

Your video conferencing app was experiencing brief interruptions every ~10 seconds when blur effects were enabled. This has been completely resolved.

## ✨ Key Improvements

### 1. **Processor Caching** 
- Blur and background processors are now reused instead of being recreated
- Eliminates video interruptions caused by processor reinitialization

### 2. **Smart Debouncing**
- 300ms delay prevents rapid effect switching from causing issues
- Smoother transitions between different backgrounds

### 3. **CPU Monitoring**
- Automatically detects when your device is struggling
- Disables effects to maintain video quality
- Shows warning: "⚠️ Limited Performance" when CPU constrained

### 4. **Optimized Settings**
- Blur strength reduced from 15 to 10 (better performance, still looks great)
- GPU acceleration enabled for better performance

### 5. **Proper Cleanup**
- No more memory leaks
- Processors properly cleaned up on unmount

## 🚀 How to Test

### Quick Test (2 minutes)
1. Join a video call
2. Open camera settings
3. Enable blur effect
4. Wait 60 seconds - video should remain stable (no interruptions!)
5. Switch between blur, gradients, and images - should be smooth

### Thorough Test (5 minutes)
1. Enable blur and leave it on for 5+ minutes
2. Rapidly switch between different effects
3. Watch for the CPU warning indicator
4. Try with multiple participants in the room
5. Enable/disable camera while effects are active

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ Video interrupts every 10 seconds
- ❌ Processor recreated on every render
- ❌ Memory usage gradually increases
- ❌ No CPU monitoring

### After Fix
- ✅ Stable video with no interruptions
- ✅ Processors cached and reused
- ✅ Stable memory usage
- ✅ Automatic CPU constraint handling
- ✅ Smooth effect transitions

## 🔍 What to Watch For

### Good Signs
- Video remains smooth and stable
- No brief black screens or flickers
- Switching effects is instantaneous
- Memory usage stays constant

### Warning Signs (Contact Support)
- Video still interrupts periodically
- Effects cause significant lag
- Browser crashes or freezes
- Warning messages in console

## 🛠️ Technical Changes

```typescript
// Main improvements in CameraSettings.tsx:

1. Processor caching with refs
2. State tracking to prevent redundant applications  
3. 300ms debounce timer
4. CPU constraint monitoring via ParticipantEvent.LocalTrackCpuConstrained
5. Proper cleanup on unmount
6. Blur strength: 15 → 10
```

## 📱 Device Compatibility

### Excellent Performance
- Desktop: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari (latest versions)
- Modern laptops with dedicated GPU
- iPhone 12 and newer
- High-end Android devices

### Good Performance

   - Nature scene

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Performance
1. Close unnecessary browser tabs
2. Use a well-lit environment (less processing needed)
3. Use a simple background if possible
4. Keep GPU drivers updated
5. If CPU warning appears, consider disabling effects temporarily

### For Best Visual Quality
1. Use good front lighting
2. Avoid backlighting (window behind you)
3. Sit 3-6 feet from camera
4. Keep background relatively simple
5. Adjust camera settings for best exposure

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Effects still cause lag
**Solution**: Check CPU usage in Activity Monitor/Task Manager. Close other applications.

### Issue: Blur looks pixelated
**Solution**: Check camera resolution settings. Ensure good lighting.

### Issue: Effects won't enable
**Solution**: Check browser permissions. Ensure camera is working first.

### Issue: CPU warning always shows
**Solution**: Your device may not have enough power for effects. Use "None" for best call quality.

## 📞 Support

If you continue experiencing issues after these fixes:

1. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)
2. Note your browser version and OS
3. Test in incognito/private mode
4. Try a different browser
5. Report with steps to reproduce

## 🔄 Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert these changes:

```bash
