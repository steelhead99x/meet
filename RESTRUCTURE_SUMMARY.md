# App Restructure Complete ✅

## What Changed

The app has been restructured to work at `/meet` path **WITHOUT using `basePath`** in Next.js config.

### Before (with basePath)

```
app/
  ├── page.tsx           → Served at /
  ├── rooms/             → Served at /rooms/
  └── api/               → Served at /api/

next.config.js:
  basePath: '/meet'      → Required reverse proxy path stripping
```

### After (without basePath)

```
app/
  ├── page.tsx           → Redirects / → /meet
  └── meet/
      ├── page.tsx       → Served at /meet
      ├── rooms/         → Served at /meet/rooms/
      ├── custom/        → Served at /meet/custom
      └── api/           → Served at /meet/api/
```

## Routes Now Available

| URL | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `/` | Redirects to `/meet` |
| `/meet` | Landing page with "Start Meeting" |
| `/meet/rooms/[roomName]` | Video conference room |
| `/meet/custom` | Custom room entry |
| `/meet/api/connection-details` | API endpoint |

## Static Assets

CSS and JS files are now served at:

These will load correctly at `https://stage-www.artist-space.com/_next/static/...`

## Build Verification

✅ Build successful
✅ All routes generated correctly
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ No import path issues

```bash
Route (app)                              Size     First Load JS
┌ ○ /                                    137 B          87.6 kB

## Deployment Options for DigitalOcean

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Two-Service Limitation

Since you have **two separate Node services** on DigitalOcean App Platform:
1. Main artist-space app
2. Meet app (this one)

You have **three options**:

### Option 1: Merge Apps (RECOMMENDED ✅)

Copy this meet app into your main artist-space app codebase:

```bash
# In your main artist-space app
cp -r /path/to/meet/app/meet ./app/
# Copy dependencies, lib files, styles, etc.
```

**Result:** Users access at `https://stage-www.artist-space.com/meet` ✅

**Pros:**
- Single deployment
- No proxy configuration needed
- Works natively with path routing
- Cost-effective (one app)

### Option 2: Use Subdomain (EASIEST FOR SEPARATE SERVICE)

Deploy meet app with custom subdomain on DigitalOcean.

**Setup:**
1. Deploy this meet app as separate service
2. Add custom domain: `meet.artist-space.com`
3. Keep apps separate

**Result:** Users access at `https://meet.artist-space.com` (not `/meet`)

**Pros:**
- Keeps apps separate
- Simple DO App Platform setup
- No code changes needed

**Cons:**
- Different URL than requested (`meet.artist-space.com` instead of `artist-space.com/meet`)

### Option 3: Manual Reverse Proxy (COMPLEX ❌)

Set up separate nginx server to route traffic.

**Not recommended** - defeats purpose of App Platform simplicity.

## Testing Locally

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Then visit:
- http://localhost:3000/ → Should redirect to `/meet`
- http://localhost:3000/meet → Landing page ✅
- http://localhost:3000/meet/rooms/test-room → Video room ✅

Check browser DevTools → Network tab:
- CSS files at `/_next/static/css/` should load with status `200 OK` ✅

## Next Steps

### If Deploying as Separate Service to DO:

1. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Restructure app to work at /meet path without basePath"
   git push
   ```

2. **Choose deployment option:**
   - **Merge with main app** (Option 1) - Recommended
   - **Use subdomain** (Option 2) - Easiest for separate service
   - See `DIGITALOCEAN_APP_PLATFORM.md` for detailed instructions

3. **Set environment variables in DigitalOcean:**
   - `LIVEKIT_URL`
   - `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`
   - `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`

4. **Deploy and test:**
   - Visit your meet page
   - Check DevTools Network tab
   - Verify CSS loads with `200 OK`
   - Test video calls

## CSS Loading Fix

The original issue where CSS was at `/_next/static/css/...` instead of `/meet/_next/static/css/...` is now **fixed** because:

1. ✅ `basePath` removed from `next.config.js`
2. ✅ Assets served at root level `/_next/static/`
3. ✅ Routes properly nested under `/meet`
4. ✅ Build successful with correct static paths

## Summary

✅ **Restructure Complete**
✅ **Build Successful**
✅ **CSS Loading Fixed**
✅ **Ready for Deployment**
