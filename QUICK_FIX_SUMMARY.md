# Quick Fix Summary - MIME Type Errors

## Problem
CSS and JavaScript files were being served with `text/html` MIME type instead of the correct types, causing the app to fail loading.

## Root Cause
Your deployment was attempting **static export** (`next export`), but your app requires a **Node.js server** because it has:
- API routes (`/api/*`)
- Dynamic routes (`/rooms/[roomName]`)
- Server-side rendering features

## Files Changed

### ✅ Modified Files:
1. **app/ToasterProvider.tsx** - Fixed SSR/hydration issues
2. **app/page.tsx** - Added `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
3. **app/custom/page.tsx** - Added `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
4. **app/rooms/[roomName]/page.tsx** - Added `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
5. **next.config.js** - Kept clean (no unnecessary exports)

### ✅ New Files:
1. **Procfile** - Tells Heroku to run `pnpm start`
2. **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Comprehensive deployment guide
3. **MIME_TYPE_FIX.md** - Detailed explanation of the fix

## What to Do Now

### Step 1: Commit the Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix MIME type errors - remove static export, use Node.js server"
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Heroku
```bash
git push heroku main
```

### Step 3: Verify in Browser Console
After deployment, open your app and check browser console:
- ✅ Should see NO MIME type errors
- ✅ CSS should load correctly
- ✅ JavaScript should load correctly
- ✅ App should work properly

## Key Points

### ❌ Your deployment was doing this (WRONG):
```bash
next build && next export  # Creates static HTML - doesn't work for your app
```

### ✅ Your deployment should do this (CORRECT):
```bash
next build  # Build the app
next start  # Run as Node.js server (via Procfile)
```

## Build Verification

✅ Local build successful:
```
Route (app)
├ ○ /                    Static (landing page)
├ ƒ /api/*               Dynamic (API routes)
├ ƒ /custom              Dynamic (video conference)
└ ƒ /rooms/[roomName]    Dynamic (video conference)
```

The `ƒ` symbol = dynamic rendering (correct for your app!)

## Expected Results After Deploy

1. ✅ All static files (`_next/static/*`) serve with correct MIME types
2. ✅ CSS loads: `content-type: text/css`
3. ✅ JavaScript loads: `content-type: application/javascript`
4. ✅ API routes work
5. ✅ Video conferencing works
6. ✅ E2EE encryption works

## If Issues Persist

1. Check Heroku logs: `heroku logs --tail`
2. Look for any "export" commands in the logs
3. Verify Procfile was deployed: `heroku run cat Procfile`
4. Clear browser cache and test again

## Quick Test Command

Before deploying, test locally:
```bash
pnpm build && pnpm start
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` and check browser console.
