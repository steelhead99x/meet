# Blur Effect Fix Summary

## Problem
Blur effect was not working while other background effects (gradients, images) were working fine.

## Root Cause
All blur quality levels (low, medium, high, ultra) were configured to use `'mediapipe-image'` processor, but the MediaPipe Image Segmenter implementation was either:
1. Not loading correctly
2. Failing silently
3. Not compatible with LiveKit's track processor interface

## Solution
Simplified the blur implementation to use LiveKit's **reliable default BackgroundProcessor** for all quality levels, which is the same processor used by the working gradient and image backgrounds.

## Changes Made

### 1. BlurConfig.ts
Changed all quality presets from `'mediapipe-image'` to `'livekit-default'`:

```typescript
// Before:
low: {
  processorType: 'mediapipe-image',  // ‚ùå Not working
  // ...
}

// After:
low: {
  processorType: 'livekit-default',  // ‚úÖ Works reliably
  // ...
}
```

**All quality levels now use:**
- `processorType: 'livekit-default'`
- `enhancedPersonDetection.enabled: false` (not needed with default processor)
- `edgeRefinement.enabled: false` (not supported by default processor)

### 2. CameraSettings.tsx
Added extensive debug logging to track blur processor creation and application:

**New logging includes:**
- Blur configuration details (radius, delegate, quality)
- Processor creation success/failure
- Track state before and after setProcessor()
- Detailed error information if processor fails

### 3. Quality Level Settings

| Quality | Blur Radius | Delegate | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Low** | 15px | CPU | Mobile, low-power devices |
| **Medium** | 45px | GPU | Standard laptops/tablets |
| **High** | 90px | GPU | Modern desktops with good GPUs |
| **Ultra** | 150px | GPU | High-end desktops |

All use the same reliable LiveKit processor, differing only in blur intensity and CPU/GPU usage.

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Open your browser console (F12)

### 3. Join a room and enable blur

### 4. Look for these console messages:

**‚úÖ Success indicators:**
```
[CameraSettings] ========================================
[CameraSettings] Creating LiveKit BackgroundProcessor (blur)
[CameraSettings] Blur radius: 45px
[CameraSettings] Delegate: GPU
[CameraSettings] Quality: medium
[CameraSettings] ========================================
[BlurConfig] ‚úÖ BackgroundProcessor created successfully
[CameraSettings] üîÑ Calling track.setProcessor() with blur processor...
[CameraSettings] ‚úÖ track.setProcessor() completed successfully!
[CameraSettings] ‚úÖ Blur processor is ready and processing frames!
[CameraSettings] ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ Blur processor applied successfully, stream remains active
```

**‚ùå Error indicators to watch for:**
```
[CameraSettings] ‚ùå FAILED to create BackgroundProcessor: <error>
[CameraSettings] ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå ERROR in track.setProcessor(): <error>
```

### 5. Test all quality levels:
1. Try Low quality (15px blur, CPU)
2. Try Medium quality (45px blur, GPU)
3. Try High quality (90px blur, GPU)
4. Try Ultra quality (150px blur, GPU)

Each should apply immediately with visible blur on your background.

### 6. Test switching between effects:
1. Start with Blur
2. Switch to a Gradient
3. Switch back to Blur
4. Switch to No Effect
5. Switch to Blur again

All transitions should work smoothly.

## What to Look For

### Visual Confirmation:
- ‚úÖ Your background should appear blurred
- ‚úÖ You (the person) should remain in focus
- ‚úÖ Higher quality = stronger blur
- ‚úÖ No black screen or frozen video

### Performance:
- **Low quality**: Should work on any device
- **Medium/High/Ultra**: Better on devices with good GPUs
- **CPU usage**: Low < Medium < High < Ultra

## Troubleshooting

### If blur still doesn't work:

1. **Check browser console for errors**
   - Look for red error messages
   - Share the full error with me

2. **Verify LiveKit is loaded**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   console.log(typeof BackgroundProcessor)
   // Should output: "function"
   ```

3. **Check browser compatibility**
   - Chrome/Edge 94+
   - Firefox 117+
   - Safari 15.4+

4. **Try different quality levels**
   - If GPU doesn't work, try Low quality (CPU)
   - If High fails, try Medium

5. **Check for WebGL**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
   const gl = canvas.getContext('webgl') || canvas.getContext('experimental-webgl');
   console.log('WebGL available:', !!gl);
   // Should output: true
   ```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

Once blur is working reliably with the default processor, we can:

1. **Add MediaPipe as an optional enhancement** for High/Ultra quality
2. **Implement edge refinement** post-processing
3. **Add temporal smoothing** to reduce flicker
4. **Optimize for mobile** devices

But first, let's make sure the basic blur works!

## Files Modified

1. `lib/BlurConfig.ts` - Changed all presets to use livekit-default
2. `lib/CameraSettings.tsx` - Added debug logging and error handling

## Build Verification

```bash
‚úì pnpm build - Successful
‚úì pnpm lint - No warnings or errors
‚úì pnpm test - All tests pass
```

## Memory Leak Fixes (Already Applied)

As part of this fix, we also ensured:
- ‚úÖ Blob URLs are properly revoked
- ‚úÖ Event listeners are removed
- ‚úÖ Temporal buffers are cleared
- ‚úÖ Console.warn is properly restored

Your app should now have both **working blur** and **no memory leaks**!
