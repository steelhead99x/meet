# Quick Fix: Improve Person Detection (Stop Detecting Boxes as People)

## Problem
Background objects (boxes, furniture, shelves) are being detected as people and not properly blurred.

## Solution: 3-Step Fix (Takes 2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Fix Your Lighting ‚≠ê **DO THIS FIRST**
**This is THE most important fix - solves 80% of detection issues**

‚úÖ **Add a lamp or light source in FRONT of you**
- Desk lamp on your desk pointing at your face
- Room lights in front of you
- Natural light from window in front (not behind)

‚ùå **Close blinds or move if you have a window BEHIND you**
- Backlighting makes you a dark silhouette
- The algorithm can't distinguish you from background objects

**Why this works:** When you're well-lit from the front, your face and body have clear edges that the ML model can easily detect. Backlighting makes everything the same darkness.

### Step 2: Enable High Quality Mode (30 seconds)
1. Click the **Settings** gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in the video interface
2. Click the **Media** tab
3. In the **Advanced** section, find **"Blur Quality"**
4. Change from "Medium" to **"High"** or **"Ultra"**

**Why this works:** Higher quality uses more advanced edge detection and stronger blur separation.

### Step 3: Simplify Your Background (1 minute)
‚úÖ **Move away from:**
- Shelves with books/boxes
- Cluttered desk areas
- Complex patterns

‚úÖ **Ideal setup:**
- Plain wall behind you (best)
- 2-3 feet of space between you and background
- Simple, uniform background

## Advanced Fix (Optional - For Power Users)

If you still have issues after the above, try **Custom Segmentation**:

1. In Settings > Media > Advanced
2. Enable **"Custom Segmentation"** toggle
3. Make sure these are checked:
   - ‚úÖ **Enhanced Person Detection** (blue highlight)
   - ‚úÖ **Temporal Smoothing**
   - ‚úÖ **Edge Refinement**
4. Move **"Blur Strength"** slider to **60-80**
5. Move **"Edge Quality"** slider to **40-50%**

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing background objects?
‚Üí **Add more front lighting** (this is 90% of the fix)
‚Üí Move further from background
‚Üí Increase "Blur Strength" slider in Custom Segmentation

### Edges look jagged or flickering?
‚Üí Enable "Temporal Smoothing" in Custom Segmentation
‚Üí Increase "Edge Quality" slider to 40-50%

### Video is laggy or freezing?
‚Üí Lower quality back to "Medium"
‚Üí Close other apps using CPU/GPU
‚Üí Disable "Edge Refinement" in Custom Segmentation

## Why This Happens

**Technical reason:** LiveKit uses MediaPipe's segmentation model which was trained on general objects (people, cars, animals, furniture - everything). It doesn't know that you only want to detect PEOPLE and blur everything else.

**Zoom comparison:** Zoom likely uses custom ML models trained specifically on millions of video conference images. They know exactly what a person looks like in a video call vs background objects.

**Privacy trade-off:** LiveKit processes video locally in your browser (privacy), while Zoom can use powerful servers (less privacy, better quality).

## The #1 Most Important Thing

> üî¶ **LIGHTING, LIGHTING, LIGHTING!**
> 
> Even the best ML model in the world (like Zoom's) struggles with bad lighting. A $10 desk lamp in front of you will make more difference than any software setting.
>
> **Front lighting** = Clear person detection ‚úÖ  
> **Backlighting** = Everything looks the same ‚ùå

## Visual Guide to Lighting

**BAD Setup (Don't do this):**
```
[WINDOW with bright light] ‚Üê [YOU sitting here] ‚Üí [Camera]
Result: You're a dark silhouette, boxes look like people
```

**GOOD Setup (Do this):**
```
[LAMP/LIGHT] ‚Üí [YOU sitting here] ‚Üê [Camera]  ...  [Wall/Background]
Result: Your face is bright and clear, background is darker
```

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Added light source in front of me
- [ ] No bright window behind me
- [ ] Set Blur Quality to "High" in Settings
- [ ] Moved away from cluttered background (if possible)
- [ ] Tried Custom Segmentation (optional)
